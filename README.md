> **👋 Welcome Early Adopter!**

## 🚀 What is AgentField?

**AgentField is "Kubernetes for AI Agents."**

It is an open-source **Control Plane** that treats AI agents as first-class citizens. Instead of building fragile, monolithic scripts, AgentField lets you deploy agents as **independent microservices** that can discover each other, coordinate complex workflows, and scale infinitely—all with built-in observability and cryptographic trust.

### The "Aha!" Moment

Write standard Python (or Go). Get a production-grade distributed system automatically.

```python
from agentfield import Agent

# 1. Define an Agent (It's just a microservice)
app = Agent(node_id="researcher", model="gpt-4o")

# 2. Create a Skill (Deterministic code)
@app.skill()
def fetch_url(url: str) -> str:
    return requests.get(url).text

# 3. Create a Reasoner (AI-powered logic)
# This automatically becomes a REST API endpoint: POST /execute/researcher.summarize
@app.reasoner()
async def summarize(url: str) -> dict:
    content = fetch_url(url)
    # Native AI call with structured output
    return await app.ai(f"Summarize this content: {content}")

# 4. Run it
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()
```

**What you get for free:**
*   ✅ **Instant API:** `POST /api/v1/execute/researcher.summarize`
*   ✅ **Durable Execution:** Resumes automatically if the server crashes.
*   ✅ **Observability:**  You get a full execution DAG, metrics, and logs automatically.
*   ✅ **Audit:** Every step produces a cryptographically signed Verifiable Credential.

## 🚀 Quick Start in 60 Seconds

### 1. Install
```bash
curl -fsSL https://agentfield.ai/install.sh | bash
```

### 2. Initialize
```bash
af init my-agent --defaults && cd my-agent
```

### 3. Run
```bash
af run
```

### 4. Call
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/execute/researcher.summarize \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"input": {"url": "https://example.com"}}'
```

<details>
<summary>🐳 <strong>Docker / Troubleshooting</strong></summary>

If you are running AgentField in Docker, you may need to set a callback URL so the Control Plane can reach your agent:

```bash
export AGENT_CALLBACK_URL="http://host.docker.internal:8001"
```

## 🧠 Why AgentField?

**Software is starting to behave less like scripts and more like reasoning systems.**
Once agents act across APIs, data layers, and critical paths, they need infrastructure: identity, routing, retries, observability, policies. We built AgentField because agents should behave as predictably as microservices.

### From Prototype to Production

Most frameworks (LangChain, CrewAI) are great for prototyping. But when you move to production, you hit walls: **Non-deterministic execution times**, **Multi-agent coordination**, and **Compliance**.

AgentField isn't a framework you extend. It's **infrastructure** that solves these problems out of the box.

| Capability       | Traditional Frameworks           | AgentField (Infrastructure)                   |
| :--------------- | :------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- |
| **Architecture** | Monolithic application           | **Distributed Microservices**                 |
| **Team Model**   | Single team, single repo         | **Independent teams & deployments**           |
| **Integration**  | Custom SDK per language          | **Standard REST/gRPC APIs**                   |
| **Coordination** | Manual message passing           | **Service Discovery & Auto-DAGs**             |
| **Memory**       | Configure vector stores manually | **Zero-config Scoped Memory & Vector Search** |
| **Async**        | Roll your own queues             | **Durable Queues, Webhooks, Retries**         |
| **Trust**        | "Trust me" logs                  | **DIDs & Verifiable Credentials**             |

## 🎯 Who is this for?

*   **Backend Engineers** shipping AI into production who want standard APIs, not magic.
*   **Platform Teams** who don't want to build another homegrown orchestrator.
*   **Enterprise Teams** in regulated industries (Finance, Health) needing audit trails.
*   **Frontend Developers** who just want to `fetch()` an agent without Python headaches.

---

## 💎 Key Features

### 🧩 Scale Infrastructure
*   **Control Plane:** Stateless Go service that handles routing and state.
*   **Async by Default:** Fire-and-forget or wait for results. Handles long-running tasks (hours/days) with **Webhooks**.
*   **Shared Memory Fabric:** Built-in, scoped memory (Workflow/Session/User) with **Vector Search** out of the box. No Redis/Pinecone required.

### 🛡️ Identity & Trust
*   **W3C DIDs:** Every agent has a cryptographic identity.
*   **Verifiable Credentials:** Prove *exactly* what the AI did.
*   **Policy:** "Only agents signed by 'Finance' can access this tool."

### 🔭 Observability
*   **DAG Visualization:** See the logic flow in real-time.
*   **Metrics:** Prometheus endpoints at `/metrics`.
*   **Logs:** Structured, correlated logs.

## 🔌 Interoperability

Call your agents from anywhere. No SDK required.

**Frontend (React/Next.js):**
```javascript
const response = await fetch("http://localhost:8080/api/v1/execute/researcher.summarize", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({ input: { url: "https://example.com" } }),
});
const result = await response.json();
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

</div>

---

## ⚖️ Is AgentField for you?

### ✅ YES if:
*   You are building **multi-agent systems**.
*   You need **independent deployment** (multiple teams).
*   You need **compliance/audit trails**.
*   You want **production infrastructure** (Queues, Retries, APIs).

### ❌ NO if:
*   You are building a **single-agent chatbot**.
*   You are just **prototyping** and don't care about scale yet.
