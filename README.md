## 🚀 Try AgentField in 2 Minutes

### Option 1: Local Install

```bash
# macOS/Linux - install CLI
curl -fsSL https://agentfield.ai/install.sh | bash

# Start control plane + create your first agent
af init my-agents && cd my-agents
af run
```

### Option 2: Docker Compose

```bash
git clone https://github.com/agentfield/agentfield
cd agentfield && docker compose up
```

Your control plane is running at `http://localhost:8080`

<details>
<summary><code>export AGENT_CALLBACK_URL="http://host.docker.internal:8001"</code></summary>

**Heads-up:** When your agent nodes run outside the Docker network (local shell, another VM, etc.) they can't be reached through `localhost`. Before starting any agent, set a callback URL that the control plane can dial:

```bash
export AGENT_CALLBACK_URL="http://host.docker.internal:8001"
```

Replace `host.docker.internal` with whatever host/IP the control plane can reach if you're on Linux or a remote machine.

</details>

**[📚 Full quickstart guide →](https://agentfield.ai/docs/quick-start)**

```python
from agentfield import Agent

# Create an agent
app = Agent(node_id="greeting-agent",
            model="openrouter/meta-llama/llama-4-maverick")

# Decorate a function-becomes a REST endpoint automatically
@app.reasoner()
async def say_hello(name: str) -> dict:

    message = await app.ai(f"Generate a personalized greeting for {name}")

    return {"greeting": message}
```

**Deploy:**
```bash
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="sk-..."
af run
```

**Call from anywhere** (REST API auto-generated):
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/execute/greeting-agent.say_hello \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"input": {"name": "Alice"}}'
```

**You automatically get:**
- ✅ REST API at `/execute/greeting-agent.say_hello` (OpenAPI spec at `/openapi.yaml`)
- ✅ Async execution: `/execute/async/...` with webhook callbacks (HMAC-signed)
- ✅ Prometheus metrics: `/metrics`
- ✅ Workflow Observability

## Why AgentField?

**TL;DR:** Most agent frameworks are built for prototypes. AgentField is infrastructure for production. If you've tried running multi-agent systems in production, you've hit these problems: agents deployed as a monolith (one team's change redeploys everyone), no proof of what your AI did for auditors, manual service discovery between agents, and building your own queues/webhooks/state management for long running AI nested calls. AgentField ships as a control plane + agent nodes architecture - like Kubernetes for autonomous software. Deploy agents independently, get cryptographic audit trails, and coordinate through zero-config shared memory. Every reasoner becomes a REST endpoint automatically.

### From Prototype to Production

| 🔴 Building Without AgentField                                                                                                                                                          | 💚 Building With AgentField                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **No cryptographic identity** - agents are names in logs; when regulators ask "prove this AI made this decision," you have editable logs with no tamper-proof record                   | **DIDs + Verifiable Credentials** - every agent gets a W3C DID; every execution produces a signed VC; export cryptographic proof chains that auditors verify offline with `af verify audit.json`                                    |
| **Monolithic deployments** - all agents in one codebase; Marketing team's update redeploys Support team's agents; coordination nightmare across teams                                  | **Control plane coordinates independent agents** - each team deploys their agent on their own schedule; discovery/routing/orchestration handled by stateless control plane; zero coordination needed                                |
| **Lost context across agent boundaries** - Agent A calls Agent B, you can't trace the full execution; no visibility into multi-agent workflows                                         | **Context propagation built-in** - `workflow_id`, `execution_id`, `session_id` flow automatically through headers; see complete DAG of which agent called which, when, why - distributed tracing without instrumentation            |
| **Manual state management** - set up Redis/database yourself; handle race conditions; write sync logic for agents to share data                                                        | **Zero-config shared memory fabric** - `await app.memory.set("key", val)` works across distributed agents; hierarchical scopes (workflow/session/actor/global); real-time change events via `@app.memory.on_change("key")`          |
| **DIY async infrastructure** - implement PostgreSQL queues with `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`, build webhook delivery with HMAC signing and retries, handle backpressure, graceful shutdown | **Durable execution ships working** - PostgreSQL-backed queues, automatic retries with exponential backoff, HMAC webhook delivery (GitHub-style), fair scheduling, Prometheus metrics, health checks for K8s - no assembly required |
| **Timeout hell for nested AI calls** - HTTP timeouts kill long-running reasoners; Agent A calls Agent B calls Agent C fails after 60s; build custom async queues and polling infrastructure | **Durable async execution** - reasoners run for hours/days without timeout; nested agent workflows (A→B→C) work natively; async endpoints + webhooks built-in; no external queue infrastructure needed |
| **Hardcoded integrations** - manually wire up service discovery; build custom REST wrappers for frontend teams; maintain API gateway; coordinate URLs across deployments               | **Auto-discovery + instant APIs** - call any agent via `await app.call("agent.function")`; every `@app.reasoner()` becomes `/api/v1/execute/agent.function` automatically; React/iOS/Android call via HTTP, no SDK needed           |

## 🏗️ Architecture

<div align="center">
<img src="assets/arch.png" alt="AgentField Architecture Diagram" width="80%" />
</div>

| Layer         | What It Does                                                  |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Control Plane | Stateless Go service; routes, observes, verifies, scales      |
| Agent Nodes   | Your independent agent microservices (Python/Go/REST/gRPC)    |
| Interfaces    | Backends via REST; frontends & external APIs via webhooks/SSE |

Each agent is a microservice. Teams deploy independently; the control plane makes them behave as one coherent system.

**More:** [Architecture](https://agentfield.ai/docs/architecture) • [API Reference](https://agentfield.ai/docs/api)


## Real-Time & Async

- **Unified API:** `POST /api/v1/execute/{agent.reasoner}`
- **Async runs:** `/execute/async/...` + signed webhooks
- **Live streams:** Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time output
- **Auto retries, backpressure, dead-letter queues**

**Docs:** [API Reference](https://agentfield.ai/docs/api) • [Observability](https://agentfield.ai/docs/observability)


## Identity & Audit (opt-in per agent)

- DIDs auto-issued for agents (`did:web` / `did:key`)
- Verifiable Credentials (W3C JSON-LD) for each execution
- Input/output hashing for proof integrity
- Offline verification for auditors (`af vc verify audit.json`)

## When to Use (and When Not)

### ✅ Use AgentField If:

- You're building **multi-agent systems** that need to coordinate
- You need **independent deployment**-multiple teams, different schedules
- You need **production infrastructure**: REST APIs, async queues, observability, health checks
- You need **compliance/audit trails** (finance, healthcare, legal)
- You want to **call agents from frontends** (React, mobile) without custom wrappers
- You're scaling to **multiple environments** (dev, staging, prod) and need consistency

### ❌ Start with a Framework If:

- You're building a **single-agent chatbot** that will never scale beyond one service
- You don't need REST APIs, observability, or multi-agent coordination
- You're prototyping and don't plan to deploy to production

### The Bottom Line

**Frameworks = Build agents** (perfect for learning)
**AgentField = Build and run agents at any scale** (perfect from prototype to production)

You can start with AgentField and skip migration pain later. Or start with a framework and migrate when you hit the pain points above.
